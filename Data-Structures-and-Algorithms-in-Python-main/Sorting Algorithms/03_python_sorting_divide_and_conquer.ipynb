        "We can now see that each `merge_sort` call itself invokes `merge_sort` twice (but with an array half the size), and also invokes the `merge` function once to merge the two resulting arrays. The two calls to `merge_sort` themselves make two recursive calls followed by an invocation of `merge`. The division continues till we reach an list of size 1 or 0. Thus, the merge sort algorithm ultimately boils down to a series of `merge` operations performed on arrays of varying sizes. Inside the `merge` function we perform comparisons and add numbers to a new array.\n",
